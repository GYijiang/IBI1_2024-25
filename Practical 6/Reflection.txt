I feel that the second and third codes are very difficult, and there are many pieces that are done with the help of AI. 
The first code is very interesting. 
This is a simulation to consider carefully. 
In many cases, the result is incorrect due to the wrong position of the calculation. I learned a lot during the debugging process. I feel like my ability to write code has improved.
